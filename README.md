# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was woring with a bank to develop a program in order to better help high school students visualize investments, and how they grow overtime. The user would type in the initial investing amount, then the monthly deposit amount they can make, followed by the percentage of interest, and lastly the amount of time. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I felt I organized the code to adhere to professionalism, and to improve readability well. I also felt that the output formatting was done very well in order to be able to read the program, and not cause clutter. 


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I feel that I could enhance my code by having even line spacing through out the entirety of the program. This in turn, would help with the readability of the code and allow for better maintainability. I also think that I could enhance my code by going in declaration order, rather than skipping around. This would help be more professional and increase the ability to catch any bugs that might exist. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

One of the most challenging pieces I found was calling the functions that hold the calculations and the calculations itself. I'm still gettting used to calling and writing functions so it made it difficult when parameters were thrown into the mix. For the calculations I was having a hard trying to get passed the logical errors. I overcame this by hopping onto the tutoring offered here at my school to verbally talk to someone and ifgure out what I was doing incorrectly. Once I connected, they helped me realize where In was going wrong.   

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

A great skill that comes from this project would be the benefit of planning and getting used to pseudocode. Also, I think that there was a great deal of time management that came into play. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I was able to make this code maintainable by using best operating practices as well as the same technique throughout the program. This will help future programmers who need to update the program know what route to take in order to do so. The code is readable by being spaced out as well as having in-line comments that discuss what the program is doing. Since programs are constantly being worked on, the program is adaptable by being able to be updated in the future. The in line comments helps the readability of the program and will then help with maintainablity and change.
